## Description

This is a Rock, Paper, Scissors game programmed with HTML, CSS and Javascript.

The user is able to choose between the three options and play against their computer.

Both the player and the computer have 3 lives to play with once they begin the game.

Also once the game begins the score-board at the top will add the number of points per win, until the lives of the player are done which is when the game will end. 

The user can then refresh the game to start it over and play again.
