## Description

This is a Rock, Paper, Scissors game programmed with HTML, CSS and Javascript.

The user is able to choose between the three options and play against their computer.

Both the player and the computer have 3 lives to play with once they begin the game.

Also once the game begins the score-board at the top will reveal the number of points per win, until the lives of the player are done which is when the game will end.
